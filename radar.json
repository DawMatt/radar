            "description": "Static error- and style-checking tools often emerge after a new language gains popularity. These tools are generically known as linters â€” after the Unix lint utility which statically analyses C code. These tools catch errors early, before code even gets compiled, and can help keep code reviews focused on more significant topics than code styles and formatting. A recent instance of this pattern is <a href=\"https://stoplight.io/open-source/spectral/\">Spectral</a>, a linter for YAML and JSON. Although Spectral is a generic tool for these formats, its main target is OpenAPI and AsyncAPI. Spectral ships with a comprehensive set of out-of-the-box rules for these specs that can save developers headaches when designing and implementing APIs or event-driven collaboration. These rules check for proper API parameter specifications or the existence of a license statement in the spec, among other things.<br/><br/>Assessing Spectral's use in both the IDE (via Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code extensions) and in build pipelines. If adopted a custom ruleset would be published to reflect BlueScope's API Guidelines, making it easier for developers to align with current best practices in API development.<br/><br/>Source: ThoughtWorks, Various"
